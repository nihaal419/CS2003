The overall layout of the generated code using umple and my code was similar. A difference I noted was that
the umple code returned boolean for set methods based on whether or not the variable was set. The umple code
also created a toString method.

The plugin can be useful to create quick templates for a class file you're going to use, because it was much
quicker to create the umple code and generate the java code than for me to create the template myself. The 
best way I think for me to use UML code is to use it as a visual outline for a project I am working on. Umple
code can then be used to generate code based on that diagram.
